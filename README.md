The objective of this lab is completing the design of the final two sub-modules of the RISC-V Single Cycle processor. Those two final modules are the controller and the ALU controller. We will be connecting them with the previously designed Datapath (previously designed in Lab #4) that contains all the lower-level modules that were designed in the labs from the beginning of the quarter. By establishing a link between the three sub-modules, the design of the processor will be completed. This will be achieved by creating two new design sources for the ALU Controller along with the Controller, and using the module instantiation commands to connect all the modules together. Additionally it is in our interest to test the functionality of the processor by making use of the provided test bench verifying that the processor is working as intended.
